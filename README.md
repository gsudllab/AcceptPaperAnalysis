# AcceptPaperAnalysis

Statistics and Visualization of main keyword of accepted papers (NeurIPS 2019)

Inspired by [`ICLR2019-OpenReviewData`](https://github.com/shaohua0116/ICLR2019-OpenReviewData) and [`CVPR-Paper-Statistics`](https://github.com/hoya012/CVPR-2019-Paper-Statistics)

The difference is that I don't use selenium for crawler. I just use requests and BeautifulSoup4 which are a bit simpler but don't support javascript.

TODO:

1. other conferences url and pattern. it should be easy.
2. ratings. I'm not sure if the rates will be public.

wordcloud should be here
